# unit-4-game
This project was created to bring you the user a chance to relax and unwind with a little math teaser.  In this project you will be instructed to click on the different images to find out the values that they hold to try and match the target score.  Careful if you lose or win the values will reset and your new target score will also. Best of luck hope you enjoy. This project was brought to you by Darius McPhatter, under the instruction of thr Rutgers Bootcamp Full-time course.
